# TasteFeat (Django Inventory Mng. sys. WebApp)
Deployed on heroku (Guest_username:guest1  Guest_password:guest@visitor) http://sarvodaysweets.herokuapp.com  <h1> </h1>
This is my another Django project for the TasteFeat(Sweet shop).
You can:
  - add daily basis factory logs.
  - add item or sweets made by which chocolatier, how much made, row weigh etc. here you dont have to add actual product detail its automatic add to the db based on raw weight.
  - can see and search details of all days production
  - same as for factory logs also
  - you can delete , update perticular details.
